## Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, 
## which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999???2008 for Baltimore City? 
## Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999???2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
